# Pole_Climber_Techevince

<em>It's a robot which can climb on poles of variable diameter and move on floor as well.<em>

<h2>Basic Skeleton:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Body of robot is Quadrilateral.</li>
<li>Four boxes of acrylic sheet(designed and cut by laser cutting) are joined by well co-ordinated racks.</li>
<li>The racks are movable , they are used to adjust body of robot across the pole of variable diameter , using rack and pinion mechanism.</li>
</ul>


<h4>There are three kind of movements:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Ground(floor)Movement</li>
  <li>Climbing Movement</li>
  <li>Body Structure(rack) Movement</li>
</ol>

- **Ground Movement:**
  - It has a set of 4 omni wheels attached to boxes.
  - Wheels are connected to diagonally opposite boxes are in same direction(they support motion in 1 degree of freedom i.e in one direction)
  - This sort of arrangement of wheel will make robot move in both horizontal and straight motion.
  - These wheels will get the bot in comfortable position to climb the pole.

- **Climbing Movement:**
  - For climbing purpose we used four (6.5 cm) wheels, connected with high torque motor wheels are fixed on the boxes ,so that they can get hold of the pole    conveniently.
  - They are capable of both upward and downword motions.

- **Body Structure(rack) Movement:**
  - As body movement of robot plays main role in getting grip for climbing , it is supposed to be fluent and must be co-ordinated accurately.
  - It has four racks supported by drawer plates(for fluent motion)
  - These racks are moved by eight pinions which are fixed in boxes.Each box contain 2 pinions.
  - Motion of pinion is controlled by servo motors
  - Boxes are designed such that rack can move through them , they have given cavities at perticular position .
