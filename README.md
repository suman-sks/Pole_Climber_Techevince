# Pole_Climber_Techevince
<em>It's a robot which can climb on poles of variable length and move on floor as well.</em>

<h2>Basic Skeleton:</h2>
<ol>
<li>body of robot is Quadrilateral.</li>
<li>four boxes of acrylic sheet(designed and cut by laser cutting) are joined by well co-ordinated racks.</li>
<li>The racks are movable , they are used to adjust body of robot across the pole of variable diameter , using rack and pinion mechanism.</li>
</ol>
There are three kind of movements:
1.Ground(floor)movement
2.climbing movement
3.Body structure(rack) movement

1.Ground Movement:
It has a set of 4 omni wheels attached to boxes.
Wheels are connected to diagonally opposite boxes are in same direction(they support motion in 1 degree of freedom i.e in one direction)
This sort of arrangement of wheel will make robot move in both horizontal and straight motion.
These wheels will get the bot in comfortable position to climb the pole.

2.Climbing movement:
For climbing purpose we used four ---sized wheels, connected with high torque motor
wheels are fixed on the boxes ,so that they can get hold of the pole conveniently.
They are capable of both upward and downword motions.

3.Body structre(rack) movement:
As body movement of robot plays main role in getting grip for climbing , it is supposed to be fluent and must be co-ordinated accurately.
It has four racks supported by drawer plates(for fluent motion)
These racks are moved by eight pinions which are fixed in boxes.Each box contain 2 pinions.
Motion of pinion is controlled by servo motors
Boxes are designed such that rack can move through them , they have given cavities at perticular position .
